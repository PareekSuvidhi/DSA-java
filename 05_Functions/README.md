# Java Functions & Methods 

This covers functions and methods in Java, aimed at beginners and intermediate learners. It includes theory and practical coding demonstrations for method creation, usage, scope, overloading, recursion, and number system conversions.


ðŸ“š Topics Covered

Part 1: Functions â€“ The Basics

Introduction to Functions  
  Understand what functions are and why we use them in Java.

SynFunction Code Demo  
  Learn the structure of a method in Java with a hands-on example.

Syntax with Parameters  
  How to pass information into functions using parameters.

Parameters vs Arguments  
  Know the difference between what you define and what you pass.

What happens in memory? (Call Stack)  
  Visualize how function calls are managed internally.

Call by Value (in Java)  
  Explore how Java passes arguments to methods â€” always by value.

Product of a & b  
  Simple example to multiply two numbers using a function.

Find Factorial  
  Demonstrate recursion by computing the factorial of a number.

Find Binomial Coefficient  
  Apply combinatorics with recursive or iterative logic.

Inbuilt vs User Defined Methods  
  Contrast between Java's built-in methods and those we create.

Function Overloading  
  Learn how multiple methods can share the same name with different parameters.



Part 2: Overloading and Number Methods

Overloading using Parameters  
  Example of method overloading based on number and type of parameters.

Overloading using Data Types  
  Overload methods using different data types for flexibility.
